            <h4>Measuring the Market Impact of Machine Learning Valuations in Auctions (The paper is available upon request.)</h4>
            <p>
                In this study, I analyzed 2.18 million randomized experiment auction sale records from GoDaddy.com to assess the market impact of machine learning valuations. Through comprehensive reduced-form analysis and structural modeling, I measured shifts in market behavior and improved prediction accuracy by 20% over baseline models. The research involved building a two-step structural model to estimate unobserved optimal bids and expected revenue.

                    <strong>BLP Model in the Case with Large Number of Goods and Markets under Overlapping Simulation Draws</strong><br>
                    Derived the asymptotic distribution of the BLP estimator to estimate demand curves, providing an analytical standard error formula. This new method significantly reduces computational costs by requiring fewer simulation draws than previous literature. Demonstrated the applicability of theoretical results using web-scraped large video game sales data.

                    <strong>Migration Experience Has Limited Negative Effect on Satisfaction: Evidence from China</strong><br>
                    Integrated a panel data set of 2,000 children and family members over 15 years to analyze the relationship between the life satisfaction of rural young people and their migration experiences. Enhanced prediction accuracy by 20% over baseline models through variable selection and model optimization with fixed-effect models.

                    <strong>Information Asymmetry in Domain Valuation: Evidence from Chinese Token Undervaluation</strong><br>
                    This project investigates how domain names with significant Chinese Pinyin token content are systematically undervalued by machine learning-based valuation algorithms. By analyzing a large dataset of GoDaddy auctions and implementing advanced tokenization techniques to capture Chinese Pinyin, the study reveals that domains predominantly composed of Chinese tokens are misclassified, leading to lower predicted prices. Regression analysis and propensity score matching are used to demonstrate that this undervaluation creates potential arbitrage opportunities for informed buyers.
